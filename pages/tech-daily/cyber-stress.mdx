## Start :

**What Causes Stress ?**

Stress happens when there are too many things happening at once, which makes the brain feel like there‚Äôs not enough time for all of them to get done. When this happens, we often feel anxious about the tasks ahead because we don‚Äôt know.

Stress falls in two cases: eustress and distress; eustress is also called "good stress" and distress is also known as "bad stress". tension is the feeling of anxiety or tension from stress, such as: Work, financial, home and family and specifically, education. This feeling of tension is common at school because students tend to care about things like: Making new friends, completing assignments, presenting, or exams. Although people seem difficulty throughout all levels of education, college tends to take the place after school.

- Causes of stress is wide ranging and result from the presence of illness, social difficulties and can also be work-related.

## Personal Thoughts :

Now that more and more people are exposed to the internet, suddenly a lot of people are online which means that cyberattacks also increase. Cybercrimes are more targeted toward newer netizens. This type of cybercrime happens at the scale of the individuals, on the other hand, corporates are the one place bigger cybercriminal groups target. These companies have their own cyber cells or third-party cyber organizations that help and monitor all the activities of that company. As these attacks get more and more frequent and common, the ones suffer have to start to shift towards the hardworking technicians that try to resolve these attacks. This has been increasingly shown in many cases. Cybersecurity is a field that sorely lacks people, hence all the work that has to resolve to have to be done by those that remain: the cybersecurity specialists. Previously, since cybercrimes already were some of the most intensive jobs to have, it has become way worse than they used to be. Just like how Internet has grown bigger to accommodate more users, the cybersecurity field also had to expand itself. While this could be seen in some firms, most of the firms have a severe shortage of people to assign the cyberattacks which led to cybersecurity specialists working overtime with their amount of work drastically increased. Before, each specialist had one case assigned to them every day which slowly has become two or three per day, causing them to overwork more frequently. This has sprouted multiple problems such as insomnia, burnout, anxiety, etc. Causing a lot of stress to these hardworking specialists. These are people who are in a lot of demand gaining more and more important as the internet grows.

## Reality :

    IN MANY COMPANIES WORKLOAD IS THE CAUSE OF MENTAL STRESS IN MANY COMPANIES SO THE COMPANIES HAVE TO ALSO CARE ABOUT THE  MENTAL CONDITION OF THEIR EMPLOYEES .. 

    THE EMPLOYEES HAVE MANY JOB RESPONSIBILITIES SO  THEY HAVE TO DO A LOT OF WORK IF THEY ARE NOT IN A  BIG MNC'S LIKE GOOGLE , AMAZON AND MICROSOFT ...

    THE WORK ENVIROMENT ALSO DEPENDS OR PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE MENTAL CONDITION OR THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE EMPLOYEE ..

    IF HE IS IN A GOOD MENTAL CONDITION HE / SHE WILL BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE TWARDS WORK AND EARN A MORE PROFIT FOR HIS COMPANY.... 

    WORK RELATED STRESS CAN BE CAUSED BY POOR WORKED ORGANISATION AND MAJORLY DEPEND ON THE COMPANY AND THE ENVIROMENRT AND WORKSPACE OF THE EMPLOYEE ..

    WITH A LACK OF CONTROL IN EMPLOYEES  COMES GREATER ANXIETY  .. THIS CAN CAUSE WOERKPLACE STRESS  IF NOT MANAGED CAREFULLY..

    WHEN THERE IS A LACK OF SUPPORT IN COMAPNIES IT ALSO CAUSE MENTAL STRES ND ALSO THE REASON OF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE VARIOUS STONES ON THEIR SHOULDERS

    THEONE CAUSE IS ALSO DEMANDING ROLES OR DEMANDING MANAGER OF THE COMPANY WHIVH MAKE OR CAUSE MORE STRESS..

    IN SOME COMPANIES BULLYING OR HARRASMENT IS ALSO THERE WHICH ALSO CAUSE MENTAL STRESS AND ANXIETY IN EMPLOYEES ...

    IN CYBERSECURITY ROLES THE WORKLOAD AND STRESS IS MORE  .. BCOZ EVERYTIME THEY HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT ANYTIME ANY HACKER CAN HACK THEIR ORGANISATIONS .. SO THEY FACE A LOT OF MENTAL STRESS .. SO THEY HAVE TO DO SECURITY CHECKS MULTIPLE TIMES IN A PARTCULAR DAY ...

    MAINTAINING RELATIONS IN OFFICE OR WORKPLACES IS ALSO A SORT OF STRESS OR DISTRACTION  WHICH ALSO CAN CAUSE MORE WORKLOAD 

    THE ONE MORE CAUSE OF STRES  IS THEIR THINKING OF THE JOB SECURITY ,   FNANCIAL WORRIES AND WORKLIFE BALANCE.. 

    THE ONE MORE IMPORTANT AND LAST CAUSE OF STRESS IS LACK OF DEVELOPMENT OPPRTUNITIES IN MANY COMPANIES
    

## CYBER- Workers' Life :

The employee who is working in Cyber Protection Organization, have to pay more attention than a Regular Employee of any company or of any Organization. Because they have to pay attention to the servers and the server code that, anyone cannot access it and change the privacy of the Website.

Employees whose salary is not soo much, that employees thinking that, how they can grow up and how they can go to Big Companies for a good amount of salary and to complete his Life Goals.

During the Pandemic, most of the Companies take a survey, and they noticed that at the time of Pandemic, most of the Users goes Online to search for a job, and about more than 66% of offline users came online for search for a job. So many people, can try to access any Organization for demanding for money. The Employees who is working into that organization have soo much workload to be aware of that peoples. Soo many Employees sought mental-health assistance for insomnia, burnout, and anxiety.
