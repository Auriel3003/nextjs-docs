# ➡ Google Maps🗺

There is no reason to introduce this technology.😁

We all rely on maps when we need information on routes or traffic, making Google Maps one of the best inventions in the field of mapping and navigation till date. 
So let's talk about the various parts of how Google Maps operate ??

Many individuals use Google Maps every day for their travels that's because the navigation tool is so good at predicting traffic and planning routes.
However, there is more complexity than what appears to be the straightforward response.


To estimate traffic, Google Maps employs machine learning in conjunction with a variety of data sources, including location-specific aggregate data, past traffic trends, information from the local government, and in-the-moment user feedback.

## ➡ Where does it obtain the data from now?

Google manages the Google Maps database with the aid of a few partners. Cross-checking the data before publishing it is crucial because it must be real-time. Google therefore uses -

**Map partners:** With the aid of the Base Map Partner Program, Google has formed partnerships with numerous data sources, and numerous organisations provide data to Google.
**Street view:** Google bases its street view photos on the GPS coordinates of moving vehicles.
**Satellites:** As a result of their partnership with Google Earth, Google Maps now includes a satellite view.

Google uses the location information that your smartphone has stored.

**Local Guides:** `Well I am one of them` Google has millions of 'local guides' in addition to its army of editors. 
- Go to My Contributions in Google Maps to look for various locations in your neighbourhood. You can add to this extra layer of data by leaving a review, responding to a few inquiries, and uploading a photo.

According to the search engines , Google Maps is used daily in more than 220 nations and territories and accounts for over one billion kilometres driven.

## ➡ Talking about day by day enhancement of Google (Maps)

At the moment, Maps has rapidly developed its technology, allowing developers access, integrating street view, and releasing Android and iOS apps at an early stage.

`Nobody had ever seen their own home in satellite photography before, much less in colour.`
`At present it is **possible** ; This is a fresh perspective on things.`

## ✅How far the Privacy is concerned 🔏

  > Any form of geolocation technology has serious privacy concerns.

For reasons such as the volume of data it gathers, street view photographs displaying private property, and using street view cars to get data from insecure wifi networks, Google has come under fire and in some cases been sued.

> According to Google, the information about you that it uses to estimate traffic and busyness is anonymised. Differential privacy is a technical treatment that we employ.
> Differential privacy enables us to keep you and your activities apart from the signals we collect from millions of individuals to gain insights on things like busyness and how long a walk or a car might take.



    They claim that the data is neither sold nor given to any parties. Google claims to provide users with privacy controls such as the ability to turn location history on or off, conduct private searches, and have location data automatically deleted.


> To preserve people's privacy and make sure we only have the essential data to power the most beneficial products, we're constantly working to improve how we manage the information we collect. - Said by Google 

## ✅🙂 Yet to enhance by Google 

There are few aspects that Google still improving... 

When there is a time estimate it isnt based on us using the Route 1. sometimes the suggested route might be good for people not using Route 1 vs using Route 1. 

eg - Better explaied below :

- Some more problem are with not cleared routes or old data. 🙂

## ✅Concluding : 

The way we travel the world has changed as a result of Google Maps.

The greatest advancement made by Google Maps is the vastly increased accessibility of geographic information for a very large audience.

- According to Google, the next version of Maps will be more thorough and immersive.

 > Google - We're using technology to produce a photorealistic representation of what it could be like to visit a park by fusing together satellite imagery, aerial imagery, street view imagery, and user contributions.

    Today, more than 1 billion people use Google Maps every month.


And in 17 years, it's evolved from a desktop application
to a massive mobile platform
that continuously updates information about a location.

Google Maps  have over 150 million people around the world
that are contributing information, with 50 million updates a day coming from the community, from the public sector.
