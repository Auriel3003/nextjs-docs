[Self-driving cars have to be safer than regular cars. The question ...](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/17/18564501/self-driving-car-morals-safety-tesla-waymo)

## Introduction :

- Self-driving cars are changing the modern transportation industry but the biggest question is will autonomous vehicles on the road make them safer or even more dangerous?

- A car without a driver can never be as safe as one with a human decision-maker calling, after all a machine could never have the experience that a human gained through years of driving.

- However, we might think we humans are actually pretty but we are terrible at not getting into accidents, even if we can establish that self-driving cars are safer in other words they get into fewer accidents compared to us.

- There's still the tricky question of who's to blame when they do get into accidents the issue of autonomous car safety and the ethics behind driverless machines need to be addressed by government before they can become commonplace in today's society.

- I have just gone through some blogs says that 90-95% of all car crashes that occurred between 2005 and 2007 were the result of driver error. All car crashes across the united states could be eliminated if one or all of the drivers in the crash should paying more attention and reacting accordingly.

- So, it's beginning to look like autonomous vehicles don't have to be perfect they just need to be able to prevent more accidents than humans can, looking into some of the data gathered from the many self-driving car projects we can take a gasp Haha.

- When Google's autonomous car hit a bus marking one of more crashes since their project began while Google's project is obviously still in development any self-driving crash sparks concerns among the general public, even after the accidents. however the track record for self-driving cars remains far better than any human.

- Tesla is making great headway as they're making autonomous driving more prominent Elon musk the CEO of Tesla as you probably know is one of the leaders in the autonomous car industry and has said that eventually, self-driving cars will be so safe that regulators will have to determine to allow them in full working, looking back to the google self-driving car project which is one of the most extensive studies of self-driving technology earlier we can begin to look at some raw data their autonomous vehicles were involved, in million miles of driving for the project and not a single one was car's fault from this data we can see that self-driving car are dramatically safer than their human.

- General speculation looking at the industry as whole self-driving cars are involved in a far fewer percentage of accidents than their human-driving counterparts, it would appear that self-driving cars are safer in fact much safer than human-driven ones now that most companies demonstrated that self-driving cars are seemly safer.

- Further discussing the need for regulating agencies their need safety determination methods, to prepare for fleets of computer-driven cars so far in all of the data that's gathered it would appear that self-driving cars are much safer than human-driven cars but a lot of work needs to be done to prove this definitively works. so that safety regulators can start regulating on it through a variety of sensing technology and creative programming self-driving cars will be able to overcome virtually every obstacle they may face out in the traffic world better than humans so self-driving cars are safe because frankly, it doesn't take much to be a better driver than we are for years.

- Many companies are working on developing self-driving cars and technology for autonomous vehicles of all types but some are bounded in terms of real-world testing and practical experience than others,

- Apple recently announced that it would be producing a self-driving car for consumers by 2024.(So Apple is hiring more employs from Tesla one way or other to quicky get into the race)

- On the other hand amazon also acquired the robo taxi startup and so on the list goes...‚Ä¶..

**Let's discuses on the six companies who are leading the path, who has made good progress on autonomous driving technology**

### 1. waymo

In the world of autonomous vehicles waymo is far and away ahead of any other company as measured by quantity and number of vehicles operating number of miles driven in the real world, this self-driving company is owned by "alphabet Google's parent company", weymo cars uses camera lighter and radar sensors as primary technology for self-driving in addition it also uses microphones to detect sirens from emergency vehicles for autonomous functionality currently the company operates autonomy level for robo taxis, most of which of a person up front functioning as a backup driver prototype testing of fully driverless autonomy level 5 vehicles is also taking place, currently this san Francisco based company has chosen Arizona for its taxi service due to the ideal weather conditions traffic and environment compared (friendly) to other locations in the world and they also added onemore testing location for winter and other conditions.

### 2. GM cruise

General motors cruise division has the world's second largest autonomous fleet, so far they've driven more than two million miles, most of the businesses vehicles look like standard Chevrolet under the skin of these cars parts have been modified for self-driving unlike other autonomous vehicle Companies being deeply integrated with one of the world's largest automakers like general motors physicians cruise to manufacture self-driving cars on an assembly line in Michigan which is capable of producing hundreds of thousands of vehicles per year for sure general motors 113-year heritage and experience in car manufacturing give it a strong edge over of other players these include tech companies like apple, tesla and google which may be stronger from an intelligence point of view but actually have comparatively little experience with real-world driving.

The company has recently started testing fully self-driving vehicles without driver monitors in san Francisco the new testing comes less than two months after crews received a permit from the California department of motor vehicles to remove the human backup drivers from its self-driving cars

### 3. Argo Ai

Ford motor company's argo ai startup is testing its 100 vehicles in at least six cities in the united states so far, although ford and volkswagen each of it is an independent venture unlike alphabet's way more gm's crews however ford and volkswagen don't allow argo ai to design its own vehicles instead they want argo to manufacture self-driving technology for other companies initially for fleet based services such as robo taxis and delivery

### 4. Tesla

Tesla Eln Musk is a competitor in the autonomy leadership it's true that tesla has more production vehicles capable of advanced levels of autonomy actually on the road than any other manufacturer yet musk has been outspoken about the exclusion of light detection and lighter technology from his cars this is despite the fact that nearly every other car maker promoting autonomous vehicles makes use of it tesla instead they uses ultrasonic radar and 2d camera devices to enable its car's autonomous operations tesla has more production vehicles on global roads and they driven over 2 billion miles, musk built up a level of experience with some autonomy features even reaching level 5 with prototype vehicles in 2019 musk boldly promised that by the end of 2020 there would be one million fully autonomous level 5 teslas on the road and he kept his promis they are more they in number thet he expected. 

### And the last one i would like to mention
Zuke's California based startup souks was acquired by amazon for more than 1 billion zuke is staking their claim in both the autonomous vehicle market and on-demand mobility developing vehicles that can drive on both city streets and freeways while maintaining the safety of their passengers their end goal is to create a fleet of independently operating cars that can serve cities as an on-demand transportation option they unveiled their 1st self-driving 4 passenger cars all-electric taxi this would be a good startup for shuttling people in parks and colleges.

**I will be referring autonomous vehicles as AV and will collectively refer to every vehicles and not just cars.**

## What is an AV?

An AV is a a mobile device that uses sophisticated and automation to provide the results i.e, transportation, Travel, going one place to another etc.

They uses various sensors like radar, sonar, lidar, inertial sensors, thermo-cameras, and emergency braking.
These are some of the components of the AV.
And collectively provides following feature.

- Autopilot navigation
- Autosteering
- Obstacle avoidance
- Automatic lane changing
- Auto-parking
- Smart Route Navigation

Presently most of the AV's are of level 2.

## What are levels?

Well they are the classification of AV as 0-5.
**Level 0** are regular vehicles with human controlls.
**Level 5** are AV with full automation and no human intervention and rest falls which can also be seen as development phases of Av falls under level3,4,5

Now talking about main topic as I am not able to hold it anymore.

- AV are not 100 percent safe right now I will consider them to be only 10 percent safe.
- It will gonna need lots of trials and erros to reach a phase of level 5 AV. Till then they are not gonna be safe.
- But I will consider level 3 or 4 AV which gonna be come by in Few years maybe by 2027 or 2030.
- They will reduce road accident and road injuries very less then  what the present trend is.

Recently i watched a reel in which a Tesla car just stopped from crash from a fast moving Vehicles That brake was so at the point that if there was a human present then it would have caused death on both sides. Cause there was also a truck from other route comming.
Truck slowed earlier since the other  was from opposite sids of the road.
But the Tesla car was on left side of the road so it was just at the point that it stopped.
If AV are gonnna be like that in future  then definitely it gonna be safe.

- But as they are computer assisted things.
- 
**There comes other aspects into view.**

What are they?

Thes are Hackers, Maintaince issue , Manufacturing defect, issue into hardware or software and trust me if any of these will be the cause then the impact will be 100x worse than a car accident.


The av can be explode By overheating just like our pc's üòº

They can be hacked by hakcers and can be used for malicious purpose like hacking a complete stranger vehicle(apple will be a lot help for itü¶æüçé) and using it for Hitman purpose, killing a man by accident, massacring public(wait damn I just gave the ideas to HitmansüôÇ) and they all can be done by sitting in a room. Amazing isn't it? :sb_samjh_rha_hu:

Think a software goes malfunctioning and av be like 
_Iss road ka Gunda hoon main"._
And just bonks every vehicle ahead.

There is one more worse impact of it. Scariest one

AV's ai starts to wake up and they starts to trap humans inside it and suffocating them.:ye_bhi_thik_hai:
So av can decrease road incident but untill the level 5 of av is archieved other aspects of av danger will be around.m

## My conclusion:

No av are not 100 percent safe and they won't be so for like 2050.
And presently they are nowhere safe to let them completely roam around(even my parents don't allow me to go on Goa trip without permission :alone: ).
A complete supervising and Monitoring is required. 

[Are Self-Driving Cars Safer Than Human Drivers? ¬ª Way Blog](https://www.way.com/blog/are-self-driving-cars-safer-than-humans/)
Will self-driving vehicles actually be safer than human drivers? There are good reasons to believe that some types of autonomous vehicles may not be capable of handling edge cases safely.

[Even After $100 Billion, Self-Driving Cars Are Going Nowhere - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-10-06/even-after-100-billion-self-driving-cars-are-going-nowhere)
They were supposed to be the future. But prominent detractors‚Äîincluding Anthony Levandowski, who pioneered the industry‚Äîare getting louder as the losses get bigger.
