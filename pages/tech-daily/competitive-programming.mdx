## ‚úÖ  Before Going to Discuss today's topic we have to know that What is Competitive Programming ??

So, Competitive programming is basically a Competition or you can also say that it is a contest where from all parts of the world, the programmers can compete in various languages. The companies or any local organization give different problems and the programmers or developers have to solve the problems in the given time. 

This contest generally help to see the ability of any programmer or any developer, and this also occur for Some Job Opportunities in that particular Company or Organization.

In that type of Contests ,  companies have also set many prizes for the programmer or also the packages. Like - 1st Prize is Laptop, Discount Coupons etc..

## üî•  Question is that Do Competitive Programming Necessary to get a Software Job ??

**My answers is Not at all....**

If you joining any tech company or any software company this is not required that you have to know much more about the programming Languages. They see the skills of you, that you own. They not just only see the programming knowledge, they also see the communication and interaction skills, How you Manage or Corporate with any people etc. 

## üî•  Skills that required to Get a job in Software or Tech Company is :-

1. The First or you can say that more important round for Coders, Programmers and Developers is Coding Round.

In this Round Company can check you coding and programming knowledge as well as skills. They give around 5-6 questions to you, and see the accuracy that how fast you can solve this questions with accuracy. They asked also about basics of Coding Languages, to check that you have the basics knowledge of coding or not. If you don't answer the Basics Problems answers, the companies does not allow you to go to the next around to compete with different programmers.

The coding round varies in different companies. In some companies they have 2 or  Coding Rounds but if you see MNCs Like :- Amazon, Flipkart, Apple, Snapchart etc. They have around - 3 to 5 coding rounds. In the round they can fully examines you, they check you basic knowledge, algorithm problem solving skills, data structures skills etc. 

The Languages also varies in different Companies. Some Companies most focus on those programmers, who have the Knowledge of Python, C++ and some companies focus on those programmers, who have the knowledge of Java Script, Python etc.

2. Communication Skill Test :- In this test companies examine you communication skills, that how you can interact with others how you can deal with any of the users etc.

3. Health & Mental Checkup :- In this Test, Companies check you mental fitness that you are eligible and fully tested to join the Company.

4. Important and Last Checkpost :- See you past history, that you cannot do any illegal or bad things in your past or your name is not in any Police Records. 

**By Passing this all steps, you are Eligible to join the Company. They send the joining letter to your address.**

**You have a limited time to report in the Company. All the expenses of shifting will be given by the Company.**

## ‚úÖ  Points you have to do to upgrade your chance to join any Tech Company :- 

1.  Resume :- It is the most important things that all the companies must check. It is a brief description of your coding skills as well as your projects also. In this you have to add you education. You have to add you programming skills. Add some Important Certificates which were awarded to you. Add you projects link which you created in your past . The project is soo important in Resume section, so you must have to create a project before applying in any company. 

2. Skills and Education

3. Your Social Media Profile which is LinkedIn. You must have a well-maintained linkedin profile with good connections with Programmers as well as Developers. The connections with a working professionals in any particular company added a plus point into your profile. 

4. If you participated in a big Contest and you scored a good rank, you must have to add also into the resume. For this, you always have to participate in contests to learn and achieve a better rank to add into your resume.

5. Internships which you have done in the past.

**That's all my views regarding this points..**


## ‚û°Ô∏è  The programming language:

The programming language plays a massive role in CP contests. Using a high-level language might make sense in developing a project but using that in a CP contest is very bad. For example, by using python which takes a lot of time to execute, and C++ which is very fast in comparison, we can understand why a language like C++ will be preferred. Not only the complexities but also the libraries and pre-built functions a language has is important as well, like the collections framework in java and the pointers in C++.

## ‚û°Ô∏è  Complexitties analysis:

The core aspect of CP is to complete the problem as fast and efficiently as possible. The time and space complexities have a deciding factor here. The problem is that there could be a lot of ways to solve it, but the programmer has to analyze the complexities and use the most efficient way to do it.

- Now with the knowledge of what Cp is, we can get on to the question. Now is CP important to get a software development role? No, not really. Sure it may help when you have a line saying CodeChef 6 stars or 7 stars on your resume which will show that you have a very strong grasp of the basics and your theoretical knowledge but that's it, for an SDE role, recruiters won't care about your theoretical knowledge. What matters is your practical skills, the projects that you've built, and your achievements in hackathons and competitions. CP will definitely help how you approach a problem and how you can solve the problem but that's not software development now is it? Now usually during an SDE role interview, there will be generically 3 rounds: 
1. Analytical and Reasoning
2. Technical round
3.  HR round

- Of course, there could be 2 or 3 technical rounds in the same interview but these are basic formats. Now in order to crack interviews, you will have to pass the technical rounds right. CP will definitely help in this round but it's not necessary, you can definitely give this round if you have solid Data Structure and Algorithms knowledge. CP is just learning DSA and finding the most efficient techniques and competing with those skills. Now, you don't really need competing skills in order to ace the technical rounds. Just knowing DSA is more than enough, again CP will surely make you think faster and more efficiently but it's not really necessary.

- However, there are some cases where interviews involve CP. The biggest example is the Google interview process for freshers where the technical round involves the most hardcore CP contests ever. The ones competing in these CP contests are the most capable coders you can find. But only the biggest companies have this type of technical round and are only used for freshers.

## ‚úÖ Best Platforms to Enhance Your Coding Skills (I also using it ) :-

1. GeeksForGeeks (This site has a very clear interface as well as good questions)
2. Code Chef
3. LeetCode
4. HackerRank
5. HackerEarth

& and there are soo many coding websites, but these are the top websites where you can learn or solve the problems. They all have a particular interface to solve any problem of any particular company. Like - Amazon, Flipkart, Snapchart etc. 

## üî•  Conclusion :- Competitive Programming is not so much necessary to get a Software Job. If you have limited coding skills or communication skills, you have also selected in the companies.
