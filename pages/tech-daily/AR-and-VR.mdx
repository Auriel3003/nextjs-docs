# Views on the Price of VR Headset by Meta and what type of Technology is this(AR-VR-ER) :


## ➡Quick Introduction :

The future of gaming, marketing, e-commerce, education, and many other industries has exciting potential for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Both technologies are renowned for their enhanced experiences that merge the actual world with the virtual one using better, 3-D images. Although the two can sometimes be confused, there are some key distinctions between them :


## ➡What is AR
Augmented reality is more effective than virtual reality (VR) as a tool for branding and gaming because almost everyone with a smartphone can access it.

With augmented reality (AR), we can see more of the real world by superimposing computer-generated data on top of what we see. 

For example : 

These days, a lot of smartphone AR applications require the user to hold their phone in front of them, and a lot of those applications use this technology. The software can show contextual information or provide gaming and social experiences that seem to be real by grabbing an image from the camera and processing it in real-time.

    Augmented reality is enhancing the user's experience of the real world.


## ➡What is VR 
Through the creation of a totally computer-generated simulation of an alternative world, virtual reality elevates these identical elements to a new level.

By totally replacing the user's field of vision, virtual reality (VR) submerges them in a digitally created virtual world. Although it is mostly utilised for leisure activities like gaming, concerts, movies, or sports ; it is quickly advancing into the social sphere.

## ✅Difference : 

    While VR is entirely virtual, AR uses a real-world environment.


    While VR users are under the system's supervision, AR users have control over their presence in the actual world.


    AR can be accessed with a smartphone, but VR requires a headgear device.


etc.

## ✅Meta & its VR Headset


In the expectation that individuals will utilize it to work in virtual reality, Meta has launched a high-end virtual reality headset in keeping the future of metaverse.

High-resolution sensors, eye tracking, and so-called "natural facial expressions" that mimic the wearer's facial movements are all features of the $1499 Meta Quest Pro headset.  - Meta

These features enable users to see mixed virtual and augmented reality in full color and make their avatars appear genuine when interacting with other avatars in virtual-reality environments.

- The corporation is spending billions on plans for the metaverse, which probably won't be repaid for many years.
- Although some gamers are already big fans of VR headsets, Meta realises that won't be enough to spread awareness of the metaverse, so it launched the VR Headset.



***✅Yet , the price of headset is too high . Still, Meta has its own measurements,***

    Analysts estimate that Meta has sold more than 15 million units of the Quest 2 headset. 


It will be interesting to see , how Meta and its Headset will perform in the market in upcoming years ✌

**VR:**

Virtual Reality or VR is basically a simulated experience that gives the user an immersive feel of a virtual world this could be in the form of video games which is the most commonly seen use case, it is applied in medical and business fields as well. The means of entering the said virtual world is using a VR headset to look around and motion controllers are used to navigating. The motion controllers differ for each manufacturer, but the headset is something each company has a set build. The headset is a display that is head-mounted with a small screen directly in front of the eyes. It also incorporates audio and video.

**Meta:**

The rise of Meta would start with the announcement from the CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg last year where he said that he would change the name of the company from Facebook to Meta. He also spoke about how Facebook would lead the world into Metaverse, it was a future of a utopia with immersive environments where socializing, working, and playing will all happen inside the augmented worlds. Since then, Meta has allocated so much manpower and money to make this let's face it, a pretty unrealistic idea to make come true.

Now, coming to the topic in end. Meta just unveiled its own VR headset on Tuesday. The headset was dubbed Quest Pro which costs a whopping 1100 dollars more than the previous version the Meta Quest 2. Zuckerberg debuted the device at Meta’s Connect conference full of AR and VR developers. The Quest Pro has improved touch controllers that contain embedded sensors, allowing for better tracking overall. It is pitched as a productivity device compared to the mass-produced older version. This VR headset is clearly forced more at more premium users since the 1500 dollars tag is way too much, in fact, you can buy an Xbox series X and a PlayStation 5 and have the remaining 500 dollars left over. This pricing was a huge disappointment to regular people who were promised a much more cost-effective VR headset. That's all from me for today's topic.
