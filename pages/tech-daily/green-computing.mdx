## ‚úÖ  Let's Discuss About What is Green Computing :--

It is the environment friendly as well as eco friendly use of Computers. It uses as a disposal of computer, manufacture chips which is harmful for environment, Reducing the Carbon emissions and also reduce the energy consumed by the data centers, tech shops, Cyber- Cafe, Manufacturers etc..

It reduces the consumption of energy from the power hubs to keep the environment eco friendly.

Every things of this advanced world has a smallest carbon chip in the back or in the front of any tech product. The carbon chip damages the environment most. Because the carbon chip is made with the use of some other technical chemicals which is harmful.

Green Computing has also a goal to reduce the carbon price tag from the products. There main goal is also to reduce the massive data consumption from the IT Industry, small power hubs, Cyber Cafe etc.

Green Computing also also increase the efficiency of Energy as well as Information Management and provide the best and appropriate analytics for the IT Industries.

Their aims is to recycling the resources to build a eco-friendly and more sustainable future. 

Computer is used in our daily life. It contains different type of harmful or you can also say that hazardous materials and also contain heavy metals and carbon chips, if it does not disposed correctly, it is soo harmful for our land, so that's why green computing helps it and give better ways how to manage it.

Green computing makes the computer usage and the computer working soo much cost effective by reducing the consumption of so much energy by cutting the extra ordinary thing.. 

Data centers just not only increase the soo much usage of the energy but also a huge cost of tech products from Companies..

## ‚úÖ How to also use Green Computing in our system or in our Computer :--

1. By Reducing the Monitor Brightness. The company set the default moniter brightness to 100%, which is soo much. Try to Use OLED display because it use less energy and gives a good amount of lights as compared to different LED or ORT Monitors.

2. If your Computer parts are at end, and cannot be used. Recycle this by giving the Recycler Man who take that products and recycle this. This is vey helpful for the environment..

3. Putting them your device in Sleep mode or you can also say that in StandBy Mode, this also helps in 5-10% of saving the power,  it is better than turning your computer switched on.

**üî• By using that points in your Daily life you can also contribute in  Green Computing to make our environment Eco-friendly..**

## ‚úÖ Let's Discuss What is Cloud Computing??

It is a type of a Computing Services which includes software,. Analytics, Storage, Data Services, Storage etc..

It is also used in Data Backup, Email Account Availability, Software Development, Big Data Analytics and some more types of Data Structures.. 

Some of the organization as well as tech companies also used this for spam or Fake dedection..

**üî• Difference between Cloud Computing and Green Computing is that Green Computing is used to clean and make eco friendly environment by making less carbon chips and recycling computer resource... **

While Cloud computing is a type of storage software, database, fraud management organization also used this.. It is most used for server management and for storage...
