> A place where I am in control, with no censorship or manupilation.

> A place where my words don't get mixed up with noise.


## How can I not be annoying ?

- Don't ask about issues you are getting in your system.
- If you don't want conversation, just use email.
- I read all my emails, so don't resend same stuff again.
- Don't mind if I fail to respond. I miss sometimes.
- After waiting for few days, You can try to connect again.
