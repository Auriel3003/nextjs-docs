**This Blog is presented by : Sahil Sawant, Sanchit Sawarkar, Riya Shah, Tayyab Sheikh**


## INTRODUCTION

Power electronics is the application of solid-state electronics to the conversion and control of electric power. Today, The conversions are now performed using switching semiconductors like diodes, thyristors, and power transistors like IGBT. These devices have streamlined circuitry, tiny designing capabilities, excellent forwarding, and reverse backing. Power electronics involves the processing of large amounts of electrical energy, as opposed to electronic systems, which are concerned with the transmission and processing of data and signals. Electronic circuits used to control the flow of energy are switched by power electronic devices.  Electric trains, lighting, and motor drives all use the devices to connect power grids to renewable energy sources. Power electronics devices provide optimal energy use and efficiency at low prices through heat sinking and gentle starting of motors.

The devices have experienced several up gradations and developments across different industry verticals. The AC/DC converter (rectifier), which is used in many consumer electronics products including personal computers and televisions, is one of the most widely used power electronics equipment. To enhance technology, manufacturers and academics are conducting considerable R&D. One of the most significant developments in the field of power electronics recently has been smart grids. They are anticipated to have a big impact on how electricity networks change.

The rest of the world changes along with the electronics industry. The most innovative innovations in the world arrive every day in deceptively small electronics boxes, and as they become standard, society changes.
India is currently experiencing a digital revolution that is increasing the use of technological devices.
The growing middle class, increased disposable incomes, and falling electronics prices all aid in the country's development.
India has a long history of being one of the world's largest consumers of electrical goods, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. 

Thanks to many government initiatives targeted at encouraging local manufacturing, India has already started to see initial activity with increased production and assembly activities across products like mobile phones and other consumer electronics.

With this surge in electronic product demand, **India’s ESDM** (Electronics System Design & Manufacturing) sector is expected to reach US$ 220 billion by 2025, growing at a 16.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2025.

**How power electronics represent the real challenge of the electric vehicle?**

While the pressure is growing on manufacturers with the end of the thermal vehicle, the subject of batteries and tensions on some materials are growing.

After Covid-19, which triggered the shortage of semiconductors,, and after the increase in raw materials, logistics and energy costs, , another issue must be taken into account in the production of electric vehicles, and that is power electronics

## For integration of renewable energy sources

Recent technological advancements in "Power Electronics" devices and their capacity to manage power flow have made it possible for renewable energy to increase exponentially. Automation technologies and power electronics-based Flexible AC Transmission (FACTS) technologies are required for seamless integration of renewable energy sources with

## Different energy sources are integrated with power electronic interfacing technologies as follows:

    1] Large wind farms have been connected increasingly with the grid using technologies such as Power Electronic Voltage Source Converters (VSC), HVDC systems consisting of Dual Converters, FACTS and Static VAR compensators (SVC) with energy storage system. Now a days, Full scale converters are used as power electronic interface which is placed between the wind turbine generator and the main power Grid. This interface satisfies the generator and grid side requirements. These converters always ensure that the turbine speed is adjusted so that maximum power can be generated. 
    
    Also, on the grid side, regardless of the speed of wind, this power electronic interface, controls frequency, active, reactive power as well as voltage. The wind turbine generators, whether it is Double-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) or variable speed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) rotate at asynchronous speed with respect to the frequency of the grid. DFIG uses Partial scale converters which are two-level Pulse width modulation Voltage source converters (VSC) and which have 30 per cent capacity of the wind turbine. These converters work at optimum operating points of the machine to produce electrical energy at 50/60Hz.Technically it shows full power controllability with a simple structure which is reliable and cost effective.

    For off-shore applications, Wind turbines with Permanent Magnet machines always require full scale converters. These converters are mostly three-level Neutral point diode clamped back-to-back converters. These converters respond to frequency changes on both sides of DC link. The output power of the converters can be adjusted to maintain the system frequency. These types of converters give one more output voltage level and less dV/dt stress as compared to two-level converters. Therefore, it is possible to convert power at medium voltage level and lower current and use smaller filter size. These power electronic converters are simple modular structures with compact designs based on high power semiconductors, Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristors (IGCT) or Insulated Gate Bipolar Junction Thyristors (IGBT). Due to their compact design, these converters can fit inside the turbine tower along with the grid harmonic filters and generator harmonic filters


## For Electric Mobility in Smart Grid Environment

The main Purpose of Electric Vehicles is to fulfil all mobility needs at the costs equivalent to those of the conventional vehicles taking into consideration green-house gas emission reduction. 

The power train system of Electric vehicle consists of power electronic building blocks as shown in Figure 4. such as voltage regulators, Choppers (DC-DC converters), Traction Inverters (DC-AC converters), on- board charger etc. Alternators require Voltage regulators are required to produce constant voltage at the battery terminals by modulation of field current.

Choppers (DC-DC Converters) are used for soft-switching where the switches are subjected to low stress and therefore give longer -life. These covert 400 V to 12V in electric vehicle. As AC motors have high efficiency instead of DC motors, AC motors are used in Electric vehicles. Traction Inverters (DC-AC inverters) are used for to supply power, to AC motors which is stored in batteries of the Electric vehicle. 

On -board chargers are power electronic converters in rectification mode used to convert AC to DC in order to charge the batteries in the electric vehicle. All other components also like ignition switch, control module, vehicle speed sensor, steering sensor etc are power electronics devices.
